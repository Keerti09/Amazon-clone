# Amazon-clone
Made an amazon clone where I utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox to mimic Amazon's multi-column layout, ensuring consistency across various screen sizes.
Designed and styled various components such as the navigation bar, product listings, and footer to closely resemble the Amazon website.
Implemented media queries to ensure the site is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
